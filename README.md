# lendTech

The project is built using spring boot and angular js.<br>
Make sure you have the following installed<br>
<ul>
<li>npm
<li>yarn
<li>sts for running the backend spring boot server
</ul>
You need to run the backend before running the ui side.<br>
The backend is decoupled from the front end to support changes in either without having to deploy both. These are later intergrated via a proxy file in the ui module<br><br>
To start the ui, go to the root of the project then navigate to lendtech-ui and <b>run npm -start</b>
